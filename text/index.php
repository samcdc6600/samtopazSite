	    <p>
Hello and welcome to samtopaz.com, you are viewing Sam's home page and are hereby invited by me (Sam) to continue viewing :). 
	    </p>	    
	    <br><br><h4>What, why?</h4>
	    <p>
		This site is a personal home page, it will contain articles written by myself as well as opinion pieces, any mixture of the two and anything else I feel like publishing.
	    </p>
	    <br><br><h4>Ontogeny Recapitulates Phylogeny</h4>
	    <p>
	    	    I am primarily interested in writing about computers. Topics may include:
	    </p>
	    	    <ul>
		    	    <li>computer programming (C++, Java and AMD 64 assembly language, at least initially,)</li>
		   	    <li>computer architecture (I may not be very knowledgeable on this topic, I however find it quite interesting,)</li>
			    <li>and operating systems (I am very interested in the idea of micro kernels.) </li>
		    </ul>

	    <br><br><h4>Navigation?</h4>
	    <p>
		Links to the main pages on the site are to the left. Links to articles are to the right
	    </p>

	    <br><br><h4>Mistakes?</h4>
	    <p>
		Please advise me via email if you find any mistakes on any of my pages. The account to email can be found on the about page. <strong>Note:</strong> a difference of opinion is not a mistake.
	    </p>
