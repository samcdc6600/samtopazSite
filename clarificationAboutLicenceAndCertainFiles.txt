Some of the files included in this repository are not of my own creation and most probably have their own licences.
I beleve these files include TypographyTimes.ttf, yuicompressor-2.4.8.jar and all or most of the files under codeHighlight (It is possible I have overlooked some number of files.)
All files output or copied over by the build.sh script are of my own creation (with the exception of TypographyTimes.ttf and the css file used to style the code sections.)
The SPECIFIC GPL licence file in the reposity does not apply to any files in the repository that are not of my own creation.
I belve these files include and only include the ones already stated. 
It does apply to files that are of my own creation.
I am not sure what the proper procedure for this sort of thing is and so I have tried to make it clear hear.
